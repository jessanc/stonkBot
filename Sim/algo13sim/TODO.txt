git ignore apikeys files and all files in pastStock and presentStock files
point all python files to one master apikeys file






pattern I see:
high volatility(>=1) and positive (c-o)/o and today-yesterday (c-o)/o sufficiently negative

essentially we're looking at an underdamped oscillation as an impulse response (impulse being the high volatility positive change (day 0), underdamped response being the subsequent fall (day 1), and rise again (day 2))





the issue with the above is that it was the second derivitive of the price change
This did not allow for effective trading, unfortunately
