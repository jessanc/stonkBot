# stonkBot
The first go at a stock trading bot using Alpaca API

Additionally, it uses AlphaVantage for simulating on past data.

Please be aware that this is a my first _real_ "software engineering" project, and a personal project at that, so the code is by no means pretty, organized well, optimized, etc. It's meant for non-day trading (i.e. having less than $25k to throw around).

The idea is to do short stints of buy-and-hold of highly volatile stocks, and cash out while it's up.

The apikeys files have the actual keys removed - if you want to try it out, you will need to get your own Alpaca and AlphaVantage keys and populate the key files
