# stonkBot
The first go at a stock trading bot using Alpaca API

Additionally, it uses AlphaVantage and a few other external sites for simulating on past data.

Please be aware that this is a my first _real_ "software engineering" project, and a personal project at that, so the code is by no means pretty, organized well, optimized, etc. It's meant for non-day trading (i.e. having less than $25k to throw around).

There are a number of different algorithms that can be found in the alpacaalgos file. As of 2020-07-12, algo12 and algo13 are the most up-to-date and operable methods. Algo10 is fundamentally different than the previous ones, and algo13 is also fundamentally different than the previous ones



## API Keys
The apikeys file has the actual keys removed for the REST APIs - if you want to try it out, **you will need to get your own Alpaca and AlphaVantage keys** and populate the key file
